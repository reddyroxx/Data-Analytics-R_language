1) 

a) 
Consistency - It is important that researchers understand the population and test the sample for consistency before going ahead with the survey. 

Diversity -  to be truly representative of the population, a sample must be as diverse as the population itself and sensitive to the local differences that are unavoidable as we move across the population.

Transparency - maintain transparency about the procedures followed while selecting the sample so that the results of the survey are seen with the right perspective.

b) 

Sampling Error - sampling error is the error caused by observing a sample instead of the whole population. The sampling error is the difference between a sample statistic used to estimate a population parameter and the actual but unknown value of the parameter.

Sampling bias - sampling bias is a bias in which a sample is collected in such a way that some members of the intended population are less likely to be included than others.
